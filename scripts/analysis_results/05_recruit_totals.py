# I don't need this dataset for SPERA, so I will come back to it later.
# I will also need to run biology.py again to get destination coordinates at
# each PLD. As of now I only have 60 day pld destinations.

# recruitment


# create a df with 9x8 rows (time x pld)
# get precentage of particles that recruit
# this will be my response variables
# I could have a few interpretations of recruitment:
#   total
#   settling anywhere other than origin mpa
#   settling on another mpa
